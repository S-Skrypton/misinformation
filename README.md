# Misinformation Mitigation on Social Networks

This project focuses on modeling and mitigating the spread of misinformation in dynamic social network graphs using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent. By using reinforcement learning, the project aims to optimize intervention policies and provide actionable insights into misinformation propagation and control.

## **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: 
  To develop a reinforcement learning-based system capable of simulating and mitigating the spread of misinformation on large-scale social networks.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic graph modeling of social networks.
  - Policy optimization for misinformation intervention.
  - Evaluation of intervention strategies.
  - Insights into ethical considerations for policy-making.

- **Core Techniques**:
  - Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Network (DQN) for sequential decision-making.
  - Graph-based Modeling: Representation of users as nodes and interactions as edges using NetworkX.
  - Data Visualization: Analysis and simulation using self-built network.
